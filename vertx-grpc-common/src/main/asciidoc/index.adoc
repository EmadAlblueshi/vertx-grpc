____
gRPC is an open source remote procedure call (RPC) system initially developed at Google. It uses HTTP/2 for
transport, Protocol Buffers as the interface description language, and provides features such as authentication,
bidirectional streaming and flow control, blocking or nonblocking bindings, and cancellation and timeouts. It
generates cross-platform client and server bindings for many languages.

Vert.x gRPC is a module that will align the programming style of Google gRPC with Vert.x style. As a user of this
module you will be more familiar with the code style using Vert.x Streams and Futures while benefiting from all the
benefits of gRPC.

For more information related to gRPC please consult the official documentation site http://www.grpc.io/.

Vert.x gRPC is split in two parts

- Vert.x gRPC Server
